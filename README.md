# Why should we use SSH?

### The two methods to clone repos: 
` SSH and HTTPS `
### There are two types of repos:
 `public repos` and `private repos`

### creating a ssh key for an individual repo
- generate the key on local system 
- copy and paste the key from the local system to the specific repo om github (ci-start-code)
- .ssh folder where we have ssh keys available 
- name the new key as 'my name' for example Bari
